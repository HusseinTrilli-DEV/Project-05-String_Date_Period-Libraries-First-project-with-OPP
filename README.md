# 💻 01 String Library


In this project, I built a reusable clsString utility class in C++ that provides a wide range of string manipulation features using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

## 🔹 Main Features Implemented

String length & word counting

Uppercase / lowercase conversions

Capitalizing or lowering the first letter of each word

Trimming spaces (left, right, full trim)

Inverting letter cases

Counting specific letters, vowels, uppercase & lowercase letters

Splitting & joining strings

Reversing words in a sentence  

Replacing words with optional case sensitivity

# 💻 02 Date Library

in this project, I implemented a clsDate utility class in C++ to handle advanced date operations using OOP principles.

## 🔹 Main Features Implemented
Get/Set day, month, year

Validate dates

Leap year checks

Day/Month/Year calculations (days, hours, minutes, seconds)

Date comparison (before, equal, after)

Add or decrease periods (days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries, millennia)

Calculate business days and vacation return dates

Print month and year calendars

# 💻 03 Periods Library

this project includes a clsPeriod class in C++ to handle periods of time between two dates using OOP principles.

## 🔹 Main Features Implemented
reate a period with StartDate and EndDate

Check if two periods overlap (IsOverlapPeriods)

Instance method to check overlap with another period (IsOverLapWith)

Print the period (Print)
